## Agents Executed

- file-structure
- dependency-analyzer
- pattern-detector
- flow-visualization
- schema-generator

## Warnings

- ⚠️ file-structure: Single test file (setup.ts) suggests limited test coverage - consider expanding test structure
- ⚠️ file-structure: docs/architecture.md/ nested structure seems redundant - flatten to docs/architecture.md
- ⚠️ file-structure: No explicit error handling or logging directories - consider adding these cross-cutting concerns
- ⚠️ file-structure: Missing common directories like lib/, dist/, or build/ - ensure build outputs are properly configured
- ⚠️ dependency-analyzer: Multiple outdated packages in development dependencies pose security risks
- ⚠️ dependency-analyzer: Large number of AI-related dependencies may impact bundle size and startup time
- ⚠️ dependency-analyzer: Missing lock file makes builds non-reproducible across environments
- ⚠️ dependency-analyzer: Some dependencies (chalk, inquirer) are multiple major versions behind
- ⚠️ pattern-detector: Token management appears to be handled separately - ensure proper rate limiting and cost control
- ⚠️ pattern-detector: LLM provider abstraction is good, but ensure error handling is consistent across providers
- ⚠️ pattern-detector: Agent registry pattern is implemented but consider thread safety if concurrent execution is planned
- ⚠️ pattern-detector: File system scanning could be resource-intensive for large codebases - consider implementing streaming or pagination
- ⚠️ flow-visualization: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'controllers')
- ⚠️ schema-generator: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prisma')
