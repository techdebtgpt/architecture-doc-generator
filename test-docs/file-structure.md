# üìÅ File Structure Analysis

## Overview
A well-structured TypeScript CLI tool for architecture documentation generation, following clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns and modular design patterns.

## Structure Organization
**Strategy**: Domain-driven modular architecture with clear separation between CLI interface, core business logic, and infrastructure concerns. Uses feature-based organization within src/ and maintains comprehensive documentation.

### Key Directories
- **src/**: Core business logic organized by domain (agents, orchestrator, llm, etc.)
- **cli/**: Command-line interface layer with command handlers
- **docs/**: Technical documentation and design decisions
- **tests/**: Test infrastructure and setup

## Patterns Detected

### Architectural Patterns
- Agent Pattern
- Provider Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Clean Architecture
- Dependency Injection
- Interface Segregation

### Organizational Patterns
- Feature-based modules
- Layered architecture
- Domain separation
- Interface-driven design

## Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- Kebab-case for files
- Descriptive suffixes (.interface.ts, .types.ts)
- Domain-prefixed naming
- Consistent command naming

### Grouping Conventions
- By domain/feature in src/
- By responsibility (agents, formatters, scanners)
- Interface and implementation separation
- Type definitions co-located with domains

## Recommendations
1. Add utils/ or shared/ directory for common utilities to avoid code duplication
2. Consider adding integration tests directory alongside unit tests
3. Add examples/ directory with sample configurations and outputs
4. Consider splitting large domains (agents/) into subdirectories if they grow
5. Add .env.example for environment configuration templates
6. Consider adding scripts/ directory for build and deployment automation


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
- Single test file (setup.ts) suggests limited test coverage - consider expanding test structure
- docs/architecture.md/ nested structure seems redundant - flatten to docs/architecture.md
- No explicit error handling or logging directories - consider adding these cross-cutting concerns
- Missing common directories like lib/, dist/, or build/ - ensure build outputs are properly configured
